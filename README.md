# When Bugs Look Alike: An Empirical Study of Similarities between Bugs

This repository contains the replication package for data extraction, processing and graphics generation. 

## Repository Structure
The repository is divided by scripts used in each of our four reserach questions. Most of the code can be executed using jupyter notebooks. 

Each notebook contains instructions for executing and extracting data. 

The data extracted and our results on manual annotation can be downloaded from: https://figshare.com/s/c12e0c1f6ab4161f1b9c
